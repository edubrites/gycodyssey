         <p>Odyssey is a new counseling application designed to help high school students plan their futures, preferably in careers that are intellectually stimulating and reasonably profitable.
         It is developed by the Guiding Youth to Careers (GYC) program at Drexel University's Center for Civic Engagement.</p>
         <p>Odyssey is the first step in creating a transparent, community-driven college access application.
         Rather than using several different log-ins and varying products 
         from commercial or state services, students using Odyssey will only need a standard
         Gmail address and password to access a simplified, ad-free interface.</p>
         <p>For simple tasks, Odyssey provides simple web forms. For complicated tasks, 
         Odyssey gives easy access to sophisticated Google documents that allow students 
         to gain extra practice with word processors and spreadsheets in a meaningful context.<p>
         <p>Unlike similar services around the web, Odyssey is inherently capable of exporting all data in a variety of formats for the user's convenience.</p>
         <h2>Odyssey is...</h2>
         <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
         <h3>a problem solver</h3>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px">Odyssey provides easy access to the kinds of worksheets that students can 
         use to improve their decision-making as they choose colleges and careers. 
         Since Odyssey uses Google authentication, the application provides seamless integration with Google Docs,
         an office suite with sophisticated collaborative features. This puts the data in students' control, and,
         unlike other applications, allows them a wide range of options in choosing how they share and save their data.</p>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px">Our library of Google Docs Templates takes the best from the web and allows anyone to create and submit new
          worksheets, making Odyssey far more flexible than any comparable service.</p>
         <h3>speedy and reliable</h3>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px"><a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/appengine/"><img src="http://code.google.com/appengine/images/appengine-silver-120x30.gif"
alt="Powered by Google App Engine" /></a></p>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px">Odyssey runs on Google's App Engine and is optimized for 
         high performance data storage and retrieval.</p>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org"><img src="/images/python-logo.png"
alt="Written in Python" /></a></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px">Odyssey features can be written and improved quickly, benefiting from the design of the Python
        programming language.</p>
         <h3>fostering community</h3>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Odyssey encourages students in computer science and engineering fields to apply
         their skills to projects that improve the community and help keep America's promise
         to realize equal opportunity for all.</p>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Anyone with a Google Docs account can create helpful templates and submit them for
         use in our application's library, and any developer with Python knowledge can get up to speed quickly and 
         help add new features.</p>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Between Drexel and the University of Pennsylvania, there are a lot of brilliant
         ideas in the University City section of Philadelphia, and we
         hope to leverage all the intellectual talent we can in order to build an innovative open-source product.</p>
         <h3>truly open</h3>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px;">We will keep our promise to release Odyssey code under a GPL-compatible license after our development
         team moves the application out of the beta phase and establishes a version control system, most likely in summer 2010.</p>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This goal is in keeping with the philosophy that a community's problems require a
         community's solutions, unencumbered by commercial considerations.</p>
